The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Activity: Activity that the person was doing while the measurements were taken
Subject: one of the thirty people who participate in the experiment
Acceletometer: the mearurement comes from the accelerometer
Gyroscope: the mearurement comes from the accelerometer
X Y or Z: correspond to one of the three-dimensional signals X, Y or Z
Body: body acceleration
Gravity: Gravity acceleration
Mag: Magnitude

Each variable different to activity and subject is the mean of each activity and subject for mean or standar deviation
